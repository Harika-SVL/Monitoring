### Hospital Management System â€“ Needs W.r.t Application Stability

* The architecture of management System is as follows

![alt text](shots/1.PNG)

* Your organization `qtinfosystems` is maintaing this system for 100 hospitals
* Now let's try to figure out some failures
    * Network failures
    * Hardware failures
    * Application failures
* You are assigned to figure out failures. To solve this issues we will figure out a pro-active approach
    * For every 1 minute
        * check if every server is responding or not
        * Check if  application is responding or not
    * Alert if the servers/applications are not responding
* Log is a record which specifies some activity done
    * Operating systems have logs, we might need to finetune it
        * Windows => event viewer
        * Linux => Syslog
    * Applications also log, try to understand about failure from there
* Tracing is an approach to figure out the flow in your system
* Every system has resource utilization information
    * cpu
    * memory
    * disk
    * network
* Metrics are values which represent some information about system/application with value as number with time dimension
* QT Info System needs a Monitoring Solution.
* Observability is what QT Info System needs i.e. they need to get
    * logs
    * metrics
    * traces
* MTTR (Mean Time To Recover) this refers to average time taken by your organization to recover from failures
* MTTF (Mean Time To Fail): This refers to average time during the certain to get an failure in your system
* SLA (Service Level Agreement): This is an agreement between service provider and customer w.r.t to availability and other important metrics

### What has to be monitored?

* There are organizations and individuals who have published the best practices on implementing a monitoring solution
    * Google Four Golden signals 
    
    [ Refer Here : https://sre.google/sre-book/monitoring-distributed-systems/ ]

    * USE method 
    
    [ Refer Here : https://www.brendangregg.com/usemethod.html ]

    * RED method 
    
    [ Refer Here :  ]

### Terms in Monitoring


* Latency
* Traffic
* Errors
* Saturation

### Some basic Stuff


* Impact of  CPU, Memory and DISK on your applicaions

![alt text](shots/3.PNG)

* _**Webserver**_ : When requests are sent, threads are created which will have its own  cpu and memory share. So as number of requests increase the load on cpu and memory increases.

![alt text](shots/4.PNG)

* Generally, to figure out the saturation points, organizations stress/load the systems with the help of performance test engineers

### Metrics

* for detailed info on logs vs metrics vs traces

    [ Refer Here : https://microsoft.github.io/code-with-engineering-playbook/observability/log-vs-metric-vs-trace/ ]

* _**Metrics**_ : Metrics are numeric time-series data.

### Logs

* Logs are text informations with no standard way/format.
* Logs from different applications/servers
    * Apache `192.168.2.20 - - [28/Jul/2006:10:27:10 -0300] "GET /cgi-bin/try/ HTTP/1.0" 200 3395`
    * For some other  applications

    [ Refer Here : https://www.ossec.net/docs/log_samples/ ]
    
* For logs we deal with text (unstructured data)
* Using logs requires a solution to
    * convert unstructured text in semi structured
    * understand logs with various format
    * Log analysis solution

### Traces

* APM ( Application Performance Monitoring) Agents can help
* We are trying to make our applications observable
* Monitoring tells you when something is wrong, while observability enables you to understand why.
* Tools

![alt text](shots/5.PNG)

### Pull vs Push Monitoring

* _**Pull Monitoring**_ : Monitoring System pulls the information from various servers/applications/network devices the metrics.

![alt text](shots/6.PNG)

* _**Push Monitoring**_ : Monitoring system get the information from various servers/applications

![alt text](shots/7.PNG)

* Examples
 1. Pull:
        * Prometheus
        * Nagios
 2. Push:
        * Log stash
        * splunk

### Elastic Stack

* This was called as ELK Stack
* ELK
    * E = Elastic Search
    * L = Log Stash
    * K = Kibana
* Architecture

![alt text](shots/8.PNG)

* _**Elastic Search**_ : This is memory or storage system in the Elastic Stack
* _**Logstash**_ : Responsible for making logs queryable
* _**Beats**_ : Export metrics, logs, traces to Elastic Search
* _**Kibana**_ : Creates dashboards and visualizations

### Google for the following

* What are popular metrics for
    * web server (apache)
    * database (mysql)
* Web Servers
    * Requests per second
    * Errors
    * Thread count
    * Response Time (Average)
* Server:
    * CPU Uilization
    * Free Memory/Used Memory
    * Disk Space
    * Disk I/O
    * Network
        * Incoming
        * Outgoing
* Databases:
    * Number of Connetions
    * Size of Data Processed per second
    * Database Size

### Applications we will be observing


* _**Traditional Applications**_ : These are the applications which run on physical or virtual machines hosted on-premises or cloud
* _**Containerized Applications**_ : These will be the applications running on kubernetes cluster.
* Technology:
    * Python

### Workflow

* Overview

![alt text](shots/23.PNG)

* We will have a system with heartbeat installed which checks if the application/server is up or not and reports the status to elastic cloud (elastic search)
* The uptime in observability section of elastic cloud will show the status of each service/server from which you can configure alerts based on connectors

### Uptime Monitoring

* For the overview of the setup

![alt text](shots/24.PNG)

* Let's create a linux machine and
    * install heart beat
    * configure heart beat to send metrics to elastic  cloud
* We will be configuring heart beat to check if the
    * apache  server is alive
    ```
    bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install apache2 -y
    ```
* _**Heart beat installation**_ :
    
* For the overview [  Refer Here : https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/heartbeat/current/heartbeat-installation-configuration.html ]

* For official doc's on installing heart beat

    [ Refer here : https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/heartbeat/current/heartbeat-installation-configuration.html#installation ] 
    
* For apt based installation

    [ Refer Here : https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/heartbeat/current/setup-repositories.html#_apt ]

* _**Configuration**_ :

* All the elastic stack is generally installed and configuration files are stored in similar directories

* _**config location**_ : `/etc/<prod-name>`

* _**install location**_ : `/usr/share/<prod-name>`

* Edit `/etc/heartbeat/heartbeat.yml` to add cloud id and auth
* What has to be monitored
    * apache server
    * Monitor types: 
    
    [ Refer Here : https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/heartbeat/current/configuration-heartbeat-options.html#monitor-types ]

* Configuration

* Start heart beat: 

    [ Refer Here : https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/heartbeat/current/heartbeat-installation-configuration.html#start ]

![alt text](shots/26.PNG)

* Now open kibana & navigate to uptime

![alt text](shots/27.PNG)
![alt text](shots/28.PNG)

* To view th down status. stop the service and wait for the page to reload

![alt text](shots/29.PNG)

* Let's create an alert to send email about status of server

![alt text](shots/30.PNG)
![alt text](shots/31.PNG)

### Exercise

* Create an alert to check if the nop-app and nop-db is up or not
* Create a linux vm install apache/nginx.
* Also create uptime dashboard in elastic stack
    * based on icmp (ping)
    * based on http

### Basic Check list

* Create a linux vm in any  cloud and ssh into it
* Create a ssh key from cloud and importing ssh into cloud from your system
* Concept of Service/Daemon
* Package management â€“ apt
* json and yaml files
*concept of sudo

* Concept of environmental variables and setting
    * User
    * System

### Expert Check list

* Understanding system architectures
* System Design fundamentals

### Troubleshooting Beats

* All the elastic componets logs can be viewed using _**journalctl**_ `journalctl -u heartbeat-elastic.service`
* Look into yaml for syntax issues and cloud id and auth for configuration
* Ensure metrics are enabled

![alt text](shots/32.PNG)
![alt text](shots/33.PNG)

### Metric Beat

* This beat collects metrics about system and some predefined applications
* Install metric beat 

    [ Refer Here : https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/8.7/setup-repositories.html#_apt ]

* We will get system and nginx metrics to elastic cloud in next session

### Metric Beats to Capture Metrics

* Enable nginx metrics
    * navigate to /etc/metricbeat/modules.d and rename nginx.yml.disabled to nginx.yml
    * copy the dashboards into bin `sudo cp -r /usr/share/metricbeat/kibana/ /usr/share/metricbeat/bin`
* Now start the metric beat after setting in metricbeat.yml
    * cloud.id
    * cloud.auth
    * kibana url
* We have configured all dashboards

    * Apache Dashboard

    ![alt text](shots/35.PNG)

### Log Analysis


* Every logging mechanism will have levels, most widely adopted levels are
    * _**INFO**_ : This is informational log
    * _**DEBUG**_ : This is informative log
    * _**ERROR**_ : This represents errors
    * _**CRITICAL/FATAL**_ : This represents serious system failures

* Logs are time based information.
* In Elastic Stack we have logstash which can extract the logs, transform and load into elastic search for querying/visualizations
* Logstash does the transformations with the help of plugins
    * _**input plugins**_ : to read from different sources,for input plugins supported by logstash

    [ Refer Here : https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/input-plugins.html ]

    * _**filter plugins**_ : to transform the log,for filter plugins

    [ Refer Here : https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/filter-plugins.html ]

    * _**output plugins**_ : to store the output to different sources, for output plugins

    [ Refer Here : https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/output-plugins.html ]

* Installing logstash :

    [ Refer Here : https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/installing-logstash.html#_apt ]

* Ideal use case for us

![alt text](shots/36.PNG)

### Logstash

* Let's create a linux vm and explore logstash

### Logstash pipeline

* Logstash pipeline syntax
```
input {}
filter {}
output {}
```
* In input section we can define the datasources from where we process inputs `Extract`
* In Filter section we define the transformations `Transform`
* In output section we define the destination `Load`
* The list of inputs is all the installed logstash input plugins and same with other sections

### Let's create a very basic pipeline which reads input from stdin and displays out to stdout

* Stdin input plugin Refer Here
* Stdout output plugin Refer Here
* Pipeline
```
input {
    stdin {
    }
}
output {
    stdout {
    }
}
```
* Create a file with above content in `/tmp/first.conf`
cd in `/usr/share/logstash` and execute the following command `sudo ./bin/logstash -f /tmp/first.conf`

![alt text](shots/37.PNG)

* Now let's the codec from rubydebug to json
Edit first.conf with following content and start logstash `sudo ./bin/logstash -f /tmp/first.conf`
```
input {
    stdin {
    }
}
output {
    stdout {
        codec => json
    }
}
```
![alt text](shots/38.PNG)

* Let's add one more output to some file `stdout => codec => rubydebug
* For file output plugin

    [ Refer Here : https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-outputs-file.html ]

```
input {
    stdin {
    }
}
output {
    stdout {
    }
    file {
        path => "/tmp/output%{+YYYY-MM-dd}.txt"
    }
}
```
![alt text](shots/39.PNG)

* Open the file for contents

![alt text](shots/40.PNG)

### Activity 2 : Let's create a pipeline to read the file /tmp/test and display the contents in stdout

* input = file
* output = stdout
```
input {
    file {
        path => ["/tmp/test"]
    }
}
output {
    stdout {

    }
}
```
* install apache and redirect `/var/log/apache2/access.log` to stdout
```
input {
    file {
        path => ["/var/log/apache2/access.log"]
    }
}
output {
    stdout {

    }
}
```
* Let's try to understand filters.
* Grok filter can parse unstructured data into fields 

    [ Refer Here : https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-filters-grok.html ]

### Grok Patterns

* Open the DevTools in Kibana and then Grok Debugger

![alt text](shots/41.PNG)
![alt text](shots/42.PNG)

* For the grok filter in logstash

    [ Refer Here : https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-filters-grok.html ]

* For writing your own patterns use regex 
    [ Refer Here : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions/Cheatsheet ]

* Let's try to build a simple pattern as shown below
